# LearningC
My Adventure Through the C Langauge:

I'm currently looking for a career in Software Engineering. Until then, I've decided to learn C in order to get a better appreciation of programming languages and hone my programming skills. Feel free to look through my code. In case you are wondering, I am currently working through an e-book called Learning C The Hard Way (http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
